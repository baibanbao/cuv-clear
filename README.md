CUV clear means the Chinese Union Version Bible without chapter and verse numbers.

This CUV bible clear version (without chapter and verse numbers) has been coded and processed by zoom.quiet who is a friend of wangpei, a Chinese Christian. This project is inspired by @Heyan3127. 

Please note that all the words are collected from the Internet and there must be errors and typos. 

Helping hands are direly needed to give proof reading of this version.

You are welcome to fork this repo. Let the words spread.

Many thanks to zoom.quiet.

God bless him and all he loves forever and ever.

Amen.
